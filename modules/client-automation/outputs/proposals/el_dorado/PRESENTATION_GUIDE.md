## 🎯 Objection Handling

**"That's expensive"**
→ "After grants, it's $94-101K. You make that back in 6 months and generate $162K profit Year 1. Plus, we automate $60K/year in manual labor."

**"We can find cheaper developers"**
→ "Developers build websites. We're strategic partners conducting 8-dimension market analysis, securing $23-38K in grants, ensuring PIPEDA/CASL compliance, and applying quant trading algorithms to marketing. Nobody else does this."

**"Can we start smaller?"**
→ "We can phase it: Phase 1 (Months 1-2) is $18K. But the full system is what generates $440K. Half measures get half results."

**"What if it doesn't work?"**
→ "Look at the competitive analysis - nobody has your positioning. The market is $680M and growing. We have William's 10 years of experience and +30% YoY growth track record. Plus, CDAP grants de-risk the investment."

**"We need to think about it"**
→ "Absolutely. Two things to consider: (1) CDAP grants are time-limited, (2) Your competitors are also looking at e-commerce. Let's schedule a discovery session to answer any questions."
