# MANUAL VERCEL REDEPLOY INSTRUCTIONS

## If the site STILL doesn't update after this push, do this:

1. Open your browser
2. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
3. Find your "el-dorado-ecommerce" project
4. Click on it
5. Click "Deployments" tab at the top
6. Find the most recent deployment
7. Click the "..." menu on the right
8. Click "Redeploy"
9. Click "Redeploy" again to confirm

This will FORCE Vercel to rebuild from scratch.

## Alternative: Deploy to Netlify (5 minutes)

If Vercel is being stubborn:

1. Go to https://app.netlify.com
2. Drag the `dist` folder from your computer onto the page
3. It will give you a live URL instantly
4. Then point your domain to that URL

The `dist` folder is here:
C:\Users\Ryzen 9 5900X\Desktop\Antigravity\el-dorado-site\dist
