## ⚠️ COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID

### 1. **Perfectionism Paralysis**

✅ Launch with good enough, improve weekly

### 2. **Ignoring Engagement**
❌ Post and ghost  
✅ Respond to every comment/DM within 4 hours

### 3. **Inconsistent Posting**
❌ Post 5 times one day, nothing for a week  
✅ Post 1-2x daily, every single day

### 4. **No Customer Service**
❌ Slow responses, unclear policies  
✅ Fast responses (chatbot helps!), clear terms

### 5. **Poor Product Photos**
❌ Blurry, dark, unprofessional  
✅ Well-lit, clear, multiple angles

### 6. **Ignoring Analytics**
❌ Post blindly without checking what works  
✅ Double down on what performs best

### 7. **Underpricing**
❌ Race to the bottom  
✅ Value-based pricing, maintain margins
